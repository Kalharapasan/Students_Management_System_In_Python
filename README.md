## üß™ How It Works

1. The frontend provides fields for student details like ID, name, DoB, age, etc.
2. Actions such as Add, Update, Delete, and Search interact with the SQLite backend.
3. The Listbox displays all the records and updates dynamically.

## üìå Example Fields

- First Name
- Surname
- Date of Birth
- Age
